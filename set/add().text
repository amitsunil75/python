In Python, the `add()` method is used to add a single element to a set. It modifies the original set by adding the specified element.

Syntax:
```
set.add(element)
```

Parameters:
- `element`: The element to be added to the set.

Return Value:
- The `add()` method doesn't return anything (`None`); it just modifies the original set in place.

Example:
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

In this example:
- The `add()` method is called on the set `my_set` with the argument `4`.
- It adds the element `4` to the set, modifying it to `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. Note that sets are unordered, so the order of elements
 in the printed set may vary.
