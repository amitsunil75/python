In Python, the `issuperset()` method is used to determine whether a set is a superset of another set or not. 
A set A is considered a superset of another set B if all elements of B are also present in A.

Syntax:
```python
set.issuperset(other_set)
```

Parameters:
- `other_set`: The set to be checked against for being a subset.

Return Value:
- `True` if the set is a superset of the specified `other_set`, otherwise `False`.

Example:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {2, 4}
print(set1.issuperset(set2))  # Output: True
```

In this example:
- The `issuperset()` method is called on `set1` with `set2` as the argument.
- It returns `True` because all elements of `set2` (2 and 4) are also present in `set1`.
- Therefore, `set1` is a superset of `set2`.

Note: A set is considered to be a superset of itself. Therefore, if you call `issuperset()`
 with the same set as an argument, it will return `True`.
