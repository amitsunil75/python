The `extend()` method in Python is used to extend a list by appending elements from another iterable
 (such as a list, tuple, set, or any other iterable object) to the end of the original list. 
 Unlike the `append()` method, which adds a single element to the end of the list, `extend()` can add multiple elements from 
 an iterable.

Syntax:
```
list.extend(iterable)
```

Parameters:
- `iterable`: An iterable object whose elements will be appended to the end of the list.

Return Value:
- The `extend()` method modifies the original list in place. It doesn't return anything (`None`).

Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
other_list = [4, 5, 6]
my_list.extend(other_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In this example:
- The `extend()` method is called on the list `my_list` with `other_list` as the argument.
- The elements from `other_list` (`[4, 5, 6]`) are appended to the end of `my_list`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
