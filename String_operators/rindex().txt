The `rindex()` method in Python is similar to the `rfind()` method, as it also finds the 
last occurrence of a substring within a string. However, unlike `rfind()`, if the substring is not
 found, `rindex()` raises a `ValueError`.

Here's the syntax of the `rindex()` method:

```python
str.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])
```

- `str`: The string in which you want to search for the substring.
- `sub`: The substring you want to find within the string.
- `start` (optional): The starting index from where the search begins. Defaults to the beginning of the string.
- `end` (optional): The ending index where the search ends. Defaults to the end of the string.

Here's an example of how to use `rindex()`:

```python
sentence = "This is a sample sentence, and it contains the word 'sample' twice."
index = sentence.rindex("sample")
print("The last occurrence of 'sample' starts at index:", index)
```

Output:
```
The last occurrence of 'sample' starts at index: 42
```

In this example, `rindex()` returns `42`, which is the index of the start of the last occurrence 
of the substring "sample" in the `sentence` string. If the substring is not found, `rindex()` raises a `ValueError`.
