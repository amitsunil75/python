In Python, the `intersection()` method is used to return a new set containing elements 
that are common to both the original set and another specified set. It essentially performs the set intersection operation, 
which finds elements that exist in both sets.

Syntax:
```python
set.intersection(*other_sets)
```

Parameters:
- `*other_sets`: One or more sets to find the intersection with the original set.

Return Value:
- A new set containing elements that are common to all specified sets.

Example:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3, 4, 5}
```

In this example:
- The `intersection()` method is called on `set1` with `set2` as the argument.
- It returns a new set `{3, 4, 5}` containing elements that are present in both `set1` and `set2`.
- The original sets `set1` and `set2` remain unchanged.

You can also use the `&` operator as a shorthand for the `intersection()` method:
```python
intersection_set = set1 & set2
```

Both approaches achieve the same result. The `intersection()` method allows you to find common elements
 from multiple sets, while the `&` operator can only be used to find the intersection of two sets at a time.
