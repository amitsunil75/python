In Python, there are various types of operators categorized based on their functionality. Here's a list of operators in Python:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
   - Addition: +
   - Subtraction: -
   - Multiplication: *
   - Division: /
   - Floor Division: //
   - Modulus (Remainder): %
   - Exponentiation: **

2. Comparison (Relational) Operators:
   - Equal to: ==
   - Not equal to: !=
   - Greater than: >
   - Less than: <
   - Greater than or equal to: >=
   - Less than or equal to: <=

3. Assignment Operators:
   - Assignment: =
   - Add and Assign: +=
   - Subtract and Assign: -=
   - Multiply and Assign: *=
   - Divide and Assign: /=
   - Floor Divide and Assign: //=
   - Modulus and Assign: %=
   - Exponentiation and Assign: **=

4. Logical Operators:
   - Logical AND: and
   - Logical OR: or
   - Logical NOT: not

5. Bitwise Operators:
   - Bitwise AND: &
   - Bitwise OR: |
   - Bitwise XOR: ^
   - Bitwise NOT: ~
   - Left Shift: <<
   - Right Shift: >>

6. Membership Operators:
   - `in`: Checks if a value exists in a sequence
   - `not in`: Checks if a value does not exist in a sequence

7. Identity Operators:
   - `is`: Checks if two variables refer to the same object
   - `is not`: Checks if two variables do not refer to the same object

These are the main types of operators available in Python. Each serves a specific purpose
 and can be used in different contexts within Python code.
