Sure, here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Access Control**:
    - **Private**: Inaccessible from outside the class (`__` prefix).
    - **Protected**: Accessible, but indicated for internal use (`_` prefix).

2. **Inheritance**:
    - **Private**: Not inherited.
    - **Protected**: Inherited.

3. **Name Mangling**:
    - **Private**: Subject to name mangling.
    - **Protected**: Not subject to name mangling.

4. **Conventions**:
    - **Private**: Double underscore prefix.
    - **Protected**: Single underscore prefix.

5. **Usage**:
    - **Private**: Hide implementation details.
    - **Protected**: Indicate internal use.

**Example**:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_attr = "Private"  # Private attribute
        self._protected_attr = "Protected"  # Protected attribute

obj = MyClass()
print(obj._protected_attr)  # Accessible
print(obj.__private_attr)  # Error: Cannot access
```




Here are the main differences between private and protected attributes in Python:

1. **Access Control**:
    - **Private**: Private attributes and methods are inaccessible from outside the class and cannot be accessed or modified directly. 
    
    They are indicated by prefixing the attribute or method name with double underscores (`__`).
    - **Protected**: Protected attributes and methods can be accessed from outside the class but are conventionally considered for 
    internal use only. They are indicated by prefixing the attribute or method name with a single underscore (`_`).

2. **Inheritance**:
    - **Private**: Private attributes and methods are not inherited by subclasses. They are effectively hidden from both external 
    users and subclasses.
    - **Protected**: Protected attributes and methods are inherited by subclasses and can be accessed from them. They indicate that 
    the attribute or method is intended for use within the class hierarchy.

3. **Name Mangling**:
    - **Private**: Private attribute names are subject to name mangling, where the interpreter changes the name to include the class 
    name to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses.
    - **Protected**: Protected attribute names are not subject to name mangling.

4. **Conventions**:
    - **Private**: Private attributes and methods are indicated by prefixing the name with double underscores (`__`), following the 
    convention of encapsulation and hiding internal implementation details.
    - **Protected**: Protected attributes and methods are indicated by prefixing the name with a single underscore (`_`), following 
    the convention of indicating that they are intended for internal use but can be accessed if needed.

5. **Usage**:
    - **Private**: Used to hide implementation details and prevent accidental modification from outside the class.
    - **Protected**: Used to indicate that the attribute or method is intended for internal use within the class hierarchy
     but can be accessed if needed from subclasses.

**Example**:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_attr = "Private"  # Private attribute
        self._protected_attr = "Protected"  # Protected attribute

obj = MyClass()
print(obj._protected_attr)  # Accessible
print(obj.__private_attr)  # Error: AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__private_attr'
```

In this example:
- `_protected_attr` is a protected attribute and can be accessed from outside the class.
- `__private_attr` is a private attribute and cannot be accessed from outside the class. Attempting to do so will
 raise an `AttributeError`.





 Certainly! Here are the main differences between public, private, and protected attributes in Python, along with a brief example:

1. **Accessibility**:
   - **Public**: Accessible from anywhere, both within the class and outside the class.
   - **Private**: Accessible only from within the class where it is defined.
   - **Protected**: Accessible only from within the class and its subclasses.

```python
class MyClass:
    public_attribute = "Public"      # Public attribute
    _protected_attribute = "Protected"   # Protected attribute
    __private_attribute = "Private"  # Private attribute

# Accessing attributes
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.public_attribute)            # Output: Public
print(obj._protected_attribute)         # Output: Protected
print(obj.__private_attribute)          # Error: AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__private_attribute'
```

2. **Name Mangling**:
   - **Public**: No name mangling.
   - **Private**: Name mangling applied (attribute name prefixed with `_ClassName`).
   - **Protected**: No name mangling.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - **Public**: Inherited by subclasses.
   - **Private**: Not inherited by subclasses.
   - **Protected**: Inherited by subclasses.

4. **Convention**:
   - **Public**: No special convention.
   - **Private**: Name prefixed with double underscore (`__`).
   - **Protected**: Name prefixed with single underscore (`_`).

5. **Encapsulation**:
   - **Public**: No encapsulation.
   - **Private**: Encapsulation enforced, hiding implementation details.
   - **Protected**: Encapsulation with limited access within class hierarchy.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public = "Public"        # Public attribute
        self._protected = "Protected"    # Protected attribute
        self.__private = "Private"       # Private attribute

class SubClass(MyClass):
    def display(self):
        print(self.public)           # Accessible
        print(self._protected)       # Accessible
        # print(self.__private)      # Error: AttributeError: 'SubClass' object has no attribute '_SubClass__private'

# Example usage
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.public)          # Accessible
print(obj._protected)      # Accessible
# print(obj.__private)     # Error: AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__private'

sub_obj = SubClass()
sub_obj.display()  # Accessible from subclass
```

These differences highlight the access levels and encapsulation characteristics of public, private, and
 protected attributes in Python classes,allowing for better control over data access and manipulation.
