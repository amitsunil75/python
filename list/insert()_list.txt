The `insert()` method in Python is used to insert an element into a list at a specified index. It modifies the original 
list by adding the specified element at the specified index, shifting the existing elements to the right.

Syntax:
```
list.insert(index, element)
```

Parameters:
- `index`: The index at which the element should be inserted into the list.
- `element`: The element to be inserted into the list.

Return Value:
- The `insert()` method doesn't return anything (`None`); it just modifies the original list in place.

Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.insert(2, "apple")
print("Updated list:", my_list)  # Output: Updated list: [1, 2, 'apple', 3, 4, 5]
```

In this example:
- The `insert()` method is called on the list `my_list`.
- It inserts the element `"apple"` at index `2`, shifting the existing elements to the right.
- The updated list `[1, 2, 'apple', 3, 4, 5]` is printed. Note that indexing in Python starts from 0, 
so the element `"apple"` is inserted at index `2`, between `2` and `3`.
