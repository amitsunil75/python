The append() method in Python is used to add an element to the end of a list. It modifies the original list by adding the 
specified element as its last element.

Syntax:
list.append(element)
Parameters:

element: The element to be added to the end of the list.
Return Value:

The append() method doesn't return anything (None), it just modifies the original list in place.
Example:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
In this example, the append() method adds the element 4 to the end of the list my_list, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 4].
