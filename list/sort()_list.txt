In Python, the `sort()` method is used to sort the elements of a list in place. It modifies the original list by arranging 
its elements in ascending order by default, or in a specified order if a custom sorting function is provided.

Syntax:
```python
list.sort(key=None, reverse=False)
```

Parameters:
- `key` (optional): A function that is called on each element of the list, and the result of the function is used for sorting. 
If not specified, the elements are sorted based on their natural order.
- `reverse` (optional): A boolean value that specifies whether the sorting should be done in descending order (`True`) or
 ascending order (`False`). By default, it is `False`.

Return Value:
- The `sort()` method doesn't return anything (`None`). It just modifies the original list in place.

Example:
```python
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
```

In this example:
- The `sort()` method is called on the list `my_list`.
- It sorts the elements of the list in ascending order.
- The modified list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]` is printed.

You can also use the `reverse` parameter to sort the list in descending order:
```python
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
my_list.sort(reverse=True)
print(my_list)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]
```

Additionally, you can use the `key` parameter to specify a custom sorting function. This function will be called on each element 
of the list, and the results will be used for sorting:
```python
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "Orange", "grape"]
my_list.sort(key=str.lower)
print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'Orange']
```
In this example, the `key=str.lower` parameter ensures case-insensitive sorting by converting all elements to lowercase 
before sorting.
