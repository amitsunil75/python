In Python, the `intersection_update()` method is used to modify the original set by keeping only
 the elements that are present in both the original set and one or more specified sets. 
 It updates the original set in place, removing elements that are not present in the specified sets.

Syntax:
```python
set.intersection_update(*other_sets)
```

Parameters:
- `*other_sets`: One or more sets to find the intersection with the original set.

Return Value:
- The `intersection_update()` method does not return anything (`None`). It modifies the original set in place.

Example:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
set1.intersection_update(set2)
print(set1)  # Output: {3, 4, 5}
```

In this example:
- The `intersection_update()` method is called on `set1` with `set2` as the argument.
- It modifies `set1` by keeping only the elements that are present in both `set1` and `set2`.
- After the operation, `set1` contains only elements `{3, 4, 5}`, which are common to both `set1` and `set2`.

It's important to note that `intersection_update()` modifies the original set in place and does not return a new set.
 If you want to create a new set containing the intersection, you can use the `intersection()` method instead.
