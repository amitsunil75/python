The `index()` method in Python is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a list.
 It returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element.

Syntax:
```
list.index(value, start, end)
```

Parameters:
- `value`: The value whose index needs to be found in the list.
- `start` (optional): The index in the list where the search starts. If not specified, the search starts from the beginning of 
the list (index 0).
- `end` (optional): The index in the list where the search ends. If not specified, the search ends at the end of the list.

Return Value:
- The index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the list.

Note:
- If the specified value is not found in the list, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError` exception.

Example:
```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 20]
index_20 = my_list.index(20)
print("Index of first occurrence of 20:", index_20)  # Output: Index of first occurrence of 20: 1
```

In this example:
- The `index()` method is called on the list `my_list` to find the index of the first occurrence of the value `20`.
- The index of the first occurrence of `20` in the list (`1`) is returned and printed. Note that indexing in Python starts 
from 0, so `20` is at index `1`.
