In Python, the `zfill()` method is used to pad a string with zeros (0) on the left side until
 the string reaches the specified width. This method is particularly useful for formatting strings that
  represent numbers, ensuring that they have a specific length by adding leading zeros if necessary.

Here's how you can use `zfill()`:

```python
number = "42"
padded_number = number.zfill(5)  # Pad with zeros to make the string length 5
print(padded_number)  # Output: "00042"
```

In this example:

- `number` is a string containing the number "42".
- `number.zfill(5)` pads the string with zeros to make its length 5. Since the original string length is 2, it 
adds three zeros to the left to reach the specified width.

The general syntax of the `zfill()` method is:

```python
string.zfill(width)
```

- `string`: The original string that you want to pad with zeros.
- `width`: The desired width of the resulting string after padding. If the length of the original string is less than
 `width`, zeros are added on the left until the length becomes equal to `width`.

It's important to note that if the original string already has a length equal to or greater than the specified width, the
 `zfill()` method will not add any zeros and will return the original string unchanged.
