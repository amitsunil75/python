The `expandtabs()` method in Python is used to replace tab characters (`\t`) in a string with spaces. 
It allows you to control the spacing between tab stops by specifying the number of spaces each tab should be expanded to.

Here's how you can use `expandtabs()`:

```python
string = "Hello\tWorld"
expanded_string = string.expandtabs(2)
print(expanded_string)  # Output: Hello  World
```

In this example, the original string contains a tab character between "Hello" and "World". When `expandtabs(2)` is
 called, each tab character (`\t`) in the string is replaced by two spaces, resulting in "Hello  World".

The `expandtabs()` method is useful when you want to format text with consistent spacing, especially when dealing with
 text that contains tabular data. By specifying the number of spaces each tab should be expanded to, you can control
  the appearance of the text when printed or displayed.
