In Python, there are several built-in data types that are commonly used. Here's a list of the main data types:

1. Numeric Types:
   - int: Integer data type represents whole numbers.
   - float: Floating-point data type represents decimal numbers.
   - complex: Complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.

2. Sequence Types:
   - list: Ordered collection of items, mutable (modifiable).
   - tuple: Ordered collection of items, immutable (cannot be modified).
   - range: Represents a sequence of numbers.
   - str: String data type represents a sequence of characters.

3. Mapping Type:
   - dict: Collection of key-value pairs, unordered and mutable.

4. Set Types:
   - set: Unordered collection of unique items, mutable.
   - frozenset: Unordered collection of unique items, immutable.

5. Boolean Type:
   - bool: Represents Boolean values - True or False.

6. None Type:
   - None: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

These are the main built-in data types in Python. Additionally, Python allows for defining custom data types using 
classes and objects.
