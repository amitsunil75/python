Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) and is used to restrict access 
to certain parts of an object and to prevent users from directly modifying internal state or data of the object. 
In Python, encapsulation is achieved primarily through the use of access modifiers and property methods.

Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Python:

### Access Modifiers:
Access modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility of attributes and methods within a class. In Python, 
there are no explicit access modifiers like `public`, `private`, or `protected` as in some other programming languages like Java. 
Instead, Python uses naming conventions to indicate the level of visibility:

1. **Public**: Attributes and methods that are not prefixed with an underscore are considered public and can be accessed from outside 
the class.

2. **Protected**: Attributes and methods prefixed with a single underscore (e.g., `_variable`, `_method()`) are conventionally
 considered protected. While they can still be accessed from outside the class, it indicates that they are intended for internal use 
 and should not be accessed directly by users of the class.

3. **Private**: Attributes and methods prefixed with double underscores (e.g., `__variable`, `__method()`) are considered private. 
They cannot be accessed directly from outside the class, and attempting to do so will result in an error.

### Property Methods:
Property methods provide a way to encapsulate class attributes by defining getter, setter, and deleter methods for accessing and
 modifying the attribute's value. This allows for more controlled access to the attribute, enabling validation and enforcement of 
 certain rules.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._value = None  # Protected attribute
    
    # Getter method
    def get_value(self):
        return self._value
    
    # Setter method
    def set_value(self, value):
        # Perform validation or other operations
        if value >= 0:
            self._value = value
        else:
            raise ValueError("Value must be non-negative")
    
    # Deleter method
    def del_value(self):
        del self._value
    
    # Define property
    value = property(get_value, set_value, del_value)

# Usage
obj = MyClass()
obj.value = 10  # Calls setter method
print(obj.value)  # Calls getter method
```

In the example above:
- `_value` is a protected attribute.
- `get_value()`, `set_value()`, and `del_value()` are property methods defining getter, setter, and deleter methods for the `value`
property.
- The `property()` function is used to define the `value` property with the specified getter, setter, and deleter methods.

Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class and provides a clean interface for interacting with
 objects, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.
