In Python, a `frozenset` is an immutable version of a set. Once created, 
the elements of a `frozenset` cannot be changed or modified. This makes `frozenset` objects hashable, and 
they can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in other sets.

### Syntax:
```python
frozenset(iterable)
```

- `iterable`: An iterable (such as a list, tuple, or another set) containing elements to initialize the `frozenset`.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Creating a frozenset from a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
frozen_set = frozenset(my_list)
print(frozen_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})

# Creating a frozenset from a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
frozen_set = frozenset(my_tuple)
print(frozen_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3})

# Creating a frozenset directly
frozen_set = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
print(frozen_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3})
```

### Properties:
- `frozenset` objects are hashable and can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in other sets.
- Unlike sets, `frozenset` objects are immutable and cannot be modified after creation.
- `frozenset` objects do not support methods that modify the set, such as `add()`, `remove()`, or `clear()`.
- Operations like union, intersection, and difference can be performed between sets and `frozenset` objects.

### Use Cases:
- Use `frozenset` when you need an immutable set-like object that can be used as a key in dictionaries or as an element in other sets.
- Use `frozenset` to create hashable sets of elements that should not be changed after creation.

```python
# Using frozenset as a key in a dictionary
my_dict = {frozenset({1, 2}): 'value'}
print(my_dict)  # Output: {frozenset({1, 2}): 'value'}
```

Overall, `frozenset` provides an immutable alternative to sets when mutability is not desired, and hashability is required.
