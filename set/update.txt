In Python, the `update()` method is used to modify a set by adding elements from another iterable
 (such as another set, list, tuple, or string) to it. The `update()` method modifies the original set in place.

Syntax:
```python
set.update(iterable)
```

Parameters:
- `iterable`: An iterable object containing elements to be added to the set.

Return Value:
- The `update()` method doesn't return anything (`None`); it just modifies the original set in place.

Example:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

set1.update(set2)
print(set1)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

In this example:
- The `update()` method is called on `set1` with `set2` as the argument.
- Elements from `set2` (`{3, 4, 5}`) are added to `set1`.
- The original `set1` is modified, and its contents are updated to `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.

You can also pass other types of iterables to the `update()` method, such as lists, tuples, or strings, and 
it will add the elements of those iterables to the set.
