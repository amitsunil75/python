In Python, the `remove()` method is used to remove a specific element from a set. It modifies 
the original set by removing the specified element if it exists. If the element is not found in the set, 
the method raises a `KeyError`.

Syntax:
```python
set.remove(element)
```

Parameters:
- `element`: The element to be removed from the set.

Return Value:
- The `remove()` method doesn't return anything (`None`).

Example:
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_set.remove(3)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

In this example:
- The `remove()` method is called on the set `my_set` with the argument `3`.
- It removes the element `3` from the set.
- The modified set `{1, 2, 4, 5}` is printed.

It's important to note that if the specified element is not present in the set, the `remove()` method 
raises a `KeyError`. To avoid this, you can use the `discard()` method, which removes an element if it exists,
 or does nothing if it doesn't exist, without raising an error.
