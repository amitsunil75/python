The `rfind()` method in Python is used to find the last occurrence of a substring within a string. 
It returns the highest index of the substring if it's found, and `-1` if the substring is not found.

Here's the syntax of the `rfind()` method:

```python
str.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])
```

- `str`: The string in which you want to search for the substring.
- `sub`: The substring you want to find within the string.
- `start` (optional): The starting index from where the search begins. Defaults to the beginning of the string.
- `end` (optional): The ending index where the search ends. Defaults to the end of the string.

Here's an example of how to use `rfind()`:

```python
sentence = "This is a sample sentence, and it contains the word 'sample' twice."
index = sentence.rfind("sample")
print("The last occurrence of 'sample' starts at index:", index)
```

Output:
```
The last occurrence of 'sample' starts at index: 42
```

In this example, `rfind()` returns `42`, which is the index of the start of the last occurrence of 
the substring "sample" in the `sentence` string. If the substring is not found, `rfind()` returns `-1`.
