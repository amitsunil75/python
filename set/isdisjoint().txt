In Python, the `isdisjoint()` method is used to determine whether two sets have any elements in common. 
If the sets are disjoint (i.e., they have no elements in common), the method returns `True`. Otherwise, 
if the sets have at least one common element, the method returns `False`.

Syntax:
```python
set.isdisjoint(other_set)
```

Parameters:
- `other_set`: The set to be checked for disjointness with the original set.

Return Value:
- `True` if the sets are disjoint (have no elements in common), otherwise `False`.

Example:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {4, 5, 6}
print(set1.isdisjoint(set2))  # Output: True
```

In this example:
- The `isdisjoint()` method is called on `set1` with `set2` as the argument.
- Since `set1` and `set2` have no elements in common, the method returns `True`.
- Therefore, `set1` and `set2` are disjoint sets.

Another example where the sets have common elements:
```python
set3 = {3, 4, 5}
print(set1.isdisjoint(set3))  # Output: False
```

In this example:
- `set1` and `set3` have the common element `3`.
- Therefore, the `isdisjoint()` method returns `False`, indicating that the sets are not disjoint.
