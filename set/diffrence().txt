In Python, the `difference()` method is used to return a new set that contains elements that are present in the original set 
but not in another specified set. It essentially performs the set difference operation,
 which subtracts elements of one set from another.

Syntax:
```python
set.difference(*other_sets)
```

Parameters:
- `*other_sets`: One or more sets whose elements are to be subtracted from the elements of the original set.

Return Value:
- A new set containing elements that are present in the original set but not in any of the specified sets.

Example:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}
```

In this example:
- The `difference()` method is called on `set1` with `set2` as the argument.
- It returns a new set `{1, 2}` containing elements that are present in `set1` but not in `set2`.
- The original sets `set1` and `set2` remain unchanged.

You can also use the `-` operator as a shorthand for the `difference()` method:
```python
difference_set = set1 - set2
```

Both approaches achieve the same result. The `difference()` method allows you to subtract elements
 from multiple sets, while the `-` operator can only be used to subtract elements of one set from another set at a time.
