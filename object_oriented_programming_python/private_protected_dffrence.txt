Sure, here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Access Control**:
    - **Private**: Inaccessible from outside the class (`__` prefix).
    - **Protected**: Accessible, but indicated for internal use (`_` prefix).

2. **Inheritance**:
    - **Private**: Not inherited.
    - **Protected**: Inherited.

3. **Name Mangling**:
    - **Private**: Subject to name mangling.
    - **Protected**: Not subject to name mangling.

4. **Conventions**:
    - **Private**: Double underscore prefix.
    - **Protected**: Single underscore prefix.

5. **Usage**:
    - **Private**: Hide implementation details.
    - **Protected**: Indicate internal use.

**Example**:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_attr = "Private"  # Private attribute
        self._protected_attr = "Protected"  # Protected attribute

obj = MyClass()
print(obj._protected_attr)  # Accessible
print(obj.__private_attr)  # Error: Cannot access
```




Here are the main differences between private and protected attributes in Python:

1. **Access Control**:
    - **Private**: Private attributes and methods are inaccessible from outside the class and cannot be accessed or modified directly. 
    
    They are indicated by prefixing the attribute or method name with double underscores (`__`).
    - **Protected**: Protected attributes and methods can be accessed from outside the class but are conventionally considered for 
    internal use only. They are indicated by prefixing the attribute or method name with a single underscore (`_`).

2. **Inheritance**:
    - **Private**: Private attributes and methods are not inherited by subclasses. They are effectively hidden from both external 
    users and subclasses.
    - **Protected**: Protected attributes and methods are inherited by subclasses and can be accessed from them. They indicate that 
    the attribute or method is intended for use within the class hierarchy.

3. **Name Mangling**:
    - **Private**: Private attribute names are subject to name mangling, where the interpreter changes the name to include the class 
    name to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses.
    - **Protected**: Protected attribute names are not subject to name mangling.

4. **Conventions**:
    - **Private**: Private attributes and methods are indicated by prefixing the name with double underscores (`__`), following the 
    convention of encapsulation and hiding internal implementation details.
    - **Protected**: Protected attributes and methods are indicated by prefixing the name with a single underscore (`_`), following 
    the convention of indicating that they are intended for internal use but can be accessed if needed.

5. **Usage**:
    - **Private**: Used to hide implementation details and prevent accidental modification from outside the class.
    - **Protected**: Used to indicate that the attribute or method is intended for internal use within the class hierarchy
     but can be accessed if needed from subclasses.

**Example**:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_attr = "Private"  # Private attribute
        self._protected_attr = "Protected"  # Protected attribute

obj = MyClass()
print(obj._protected_attr)  # Accessible
print(obj.__private_attr)  # Error: AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute '__private_attr'
```

In this example:
- `_protected_attr` is a protected attribute and can be accessed from outside the class.
- `__private_attr` is a private attribute and cannot be accessed from outside the class. Attempting to do so will
 raise an `AttributeError`.
